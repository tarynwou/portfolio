							Hi there! My name is Taryn, and as a lifelong
							learner, I have always tried to put myself in
							situations that allow me to meet new people and grow
							as an individual. Currently, I am interested in
							pursuing front-end development and UI/UX. Though, I
							am an explorer of many interests, including social
							entrepreneurship, marketing, digital media,
							psychology, and education.
							<br></br>
							<br></br>
							Service is a large part of my everyday being, and I
							hope to drive value back into the communities that
							have touched my life. I would like to think all of
							the activities I partake in, be it work or
							extracurricular-related, have a positive impact on
							the community in one way or another. At my core, I
							am extremely passionate about making education and
							personal development opportunities more accessible,
							especially to underserved demographics.
							<br></br>
							<br></br>
							In my spare time, you may find me playing board
							games with friends, listening to a random (but
							informative) podcast, or chowing down on a bowl of
							pok√©. I am an extroverted introvert who draws energy
							from constantly being around others but also stays
							up late to be alone with their thoughts. All in all,
							I am curious about new experiences and welcome
							anyone who wants to chat!
